            <div class="Box1Text">
                Each Season of FIRST Robotics starts with a kit of parts that students use to begin their process of developing their robot. This process is filled with imagination, design, programing, full-scale construction, and industrial-style robots for an action-packed game opened every January/February. These robots face off and compete in various uniquely themed fields and gamemodes, where teams compete in alliences to embody the spirit of 360-degree learning with the support of their adult mentors.

                Sullivan's Five Star FIRST robotics team is a team that builds their robot to participate in the FIRST robotics competitions. These competitions we participate in are robotics competitions that inspire innovation, build confidence, and prepare the team for the future. Additionally, these competitions progress and develop STEM skills, through teamwork, problem-solving, strategy, coding, mechanical design, and hands on development. By challenging students to work creatively and collaboratively, the Five FIRST Robotics team prepares its members for future STEM related opportunities.
