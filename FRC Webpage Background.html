                FIRST Robotics is an international robotics competition that was founded in 1989 by Prolific Inventor Dean Kamen. FIRST is an abbreviation for "For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology". Dean Kamen founded FIRST Robotics to inspire young people to pursue STEM, become leaders, and become innovators. In 1992, a competition was held where twenty-eight teams of high school students competed in a school gymnasium, this event was attended by president George H.W. Bush. In 1997 various sponsors supported the program, which helped FIRST Robotics reach the stage it is at today.
